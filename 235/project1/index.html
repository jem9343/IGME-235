            <p>Save now by building the Heathkit H-100 yourself. Save later because your computer investment won't
                become obsolete for many years to come.</p>

        <p>Save by building it yourself. You can save hundreds of dollars over assembled prices when you choose the new
            H-100 16-Bit/8-Bit Computer Kit - money you can use to buy the peripherals and software of your choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The H-100 is easy to build - the step-by-step Heathkit manual shows you how. And every step of the way, you have our pledge - "We won't let you fail."
