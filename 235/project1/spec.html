            <p> Save by building it yourself. You can save hundreds of dollars over assembled prices when you choose the
                new H-100 16-Bit/8-Bit Computer Kit - money you can use to buy the peripherals and software of your
                choice.

                The H-100 is easy to build - the step-by-step Heathkit manual shows you how. And every step of the way,
                you have our pledge - "We won't let you fail." Help is as close as your phone, or the nearest Heathkit
                Electronic Center.

            <p>
                And what better way to learn state-of-the-art computing techniques than to build the world's only
                16-bit/8-bit computer kit? To run today's higher speed, higher-performance 16-bit software, you need an
                H-100. It makes a big difference by processing more data faster.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Dual Microprocessors for power and compatability. The H-100 handles both high-performance 16-bit
                software and most current Heath/Zenith 8-bit software.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Want room to grow? The H-100's standard 128L byte Random Access Memory complement can be expanded to
                768K bytes -- compared to a 64L standard for many desktop computers.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                And the industry-standard S-100 card slots support memory expansion and additional support decvices,
                increasing future upgradibility of the H-100.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                High-capacity disk storage, too. The H-100's 5.25" floppy disk drive can store 320K bytes on a single
                disk. The computer also can store 320K bytes on a single disk. The computer also supports an optional
                second 5.25" and external 8" floppy disk drives. And an optional internal Winchster disk drive will be
                available soon.
