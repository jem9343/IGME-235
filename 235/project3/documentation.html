        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>When searcing for APIs, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for this project. I never considered myself good at
            working with data, so I wanted to find a way to get data that I found interesting.</p>
        <p>I originally wanted my project to be an recipe finder based on ingredients, but all of the APIs that had that
            capability needed a key. I decided to search around on the Jikan API, and I was excited to find that there
            was a manga search option!</p>

        <img src="mockup api.png" alt="Mockup for API">
        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <p>For my project 2, I am planning on creating a manga database tool with a search function utilizing the
            Jikan
            API. This toolâ€™s audience are fans of manga and anime (mostly young adults), as well as general fans of
            Japanese
            culture who are curious about manga. When digging into the Jikan API, I noticed that it had a lot of
            results
            regarding manga and manga characters, and none of the project 2 examples focused on this area.</p>

        <p>The main function will be a general search bar to get a manga by title, as well as advanced search
            features
            including the type of manga (like "oneshot", "doujin", and "manhwa"), filtering
            for a minimum/maximum score, as well as current status ("publishing" "complete" "hiatus" "discontinued"
            "upcoming").

            <h3>Testing and Challenges</h3>
            <p> However, when I asked other people for their opinions, I realized that it was unintuitive because we
                read
                left to right.</p>
            <p>Also, figuring out how to set up the filtering for genre was difficult because of the checkboxes.</p>
