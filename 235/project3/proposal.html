        <h1>PROJECT 3 PROPOSAL</h1>
    </header>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <h1>I. High Concept</h1>
        <p> Add a High Concept: A 1-3 sentence description that pitches and summarizes your game. Examples in link
            below.
            This interactive experience is</p>
        <h1>II. Genre</h1>
        <p>Genre: Identify the genre(s) the experience belongs to. There are sample lists of genres provided in the link
            below.</p>

        <h1>III. Platform</h1>
        <p>Platform: Desktop web, mobile web, both, other?</p>

        <h1>IV. Story</h1>
        <p>This experience focuses on the findings of the National Living Meat Research, with interactive and game-like
            segments that unsettle and clue-in the player to the greater narrative. National Living Research
            investigates and categorizes a genus of creatures dubbed “Vita Carnis”.</p>
        <p>Each creature is made of “muscle, organs, and bones” and “greatly resemble mammals without skin or raw meat”.
            Vita Carnis have appeared worldwide recently and the different species range from harmless plant-like
            structures to elongated
            humanoids, all of which seem to be designed to put humans back on the food chain.</p>

        <h1>V. Aesthetics</h1>
        <p>Aesthetics: How would you describe the desired graphic style... You might not make it there, but what are you
            aiming
            for?</p>
        <h1>VI. Gameplay</h1>
        <p>Gameplay: Discuss what choices the player will be able to make and what kind of control they have to make
            those
            choices. How will the player learn how to play?</p>
        <h1>VII. Mockups</h1>
        <p>Mockups: Provide at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand-drawn sketches captured on a phone
            camera,
            Photoshop mockups, etc. Use tags and reduce the size of the image so that aren't downloaded at ridiculously
            high
            resolutions. (no more than twice the desired pixel dimensions on the page).</p>

        <h1>VIII. Other</h1>
        <p>Other: Anything else that you like to say, like discuss external libraries you'd like to use, etc.
            I did not create the lore of Vita Carnis- it was created by a Youtuber named <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/@darian_quilloy/videos" target="_blank">Darian Quilloy.</a>
        </p>
        <p>I’m a really big fan and I was inspired by his unique web series to
            create a game like this. Before working on this project, I wanted to get express consent from the creator of
            Vita
            Carnis. I reached out to him on Reddit, asking if I could adapt the video series into an interactive web
            experience.
            I’ve attached our conversation below.</p>


        <h1>IX. About the developer</h1>
        <p>I'm Jay Miller- a second year Game Design and Development student, minoring in 2D Studio
            Art and Psychology. </p>
        <p>My goal as a developer is to create philosophical experiences that deal with the human condition and push the
            limits of “what is a game?”. Outside of class, I spend time trying to improve my art, perform onstage,
            and get too deeply invested in obscure media.</p>
