        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Probably a first, The Beginner's Guide is presented as a guided tour through the work of another developer, named Coda.
            This developer is real and created numerous experimental small games using the Source engine from 2008 to 2011, the year in which he stopped developing games altogether.
            </p>
            <p>The player is guided through this list of small games by the voice of Davey Wreden, the actual director of the game and co-designer and co-writer of The Stanley Parable.
                Similar to that game, The Beginner's Guide can be considered a game about game design and about how players interact with games and, in a way, communicate with game developers.</p>
